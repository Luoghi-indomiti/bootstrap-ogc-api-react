# 🥳 Well done!

## If you are looking for an extra challenge, it would be nice to have...
* Give some extra style to the code and to the application 💌 
* Load the features GeoJSONs on a map 🗺️
* Use [React context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) to store url endpoint ⚛️
* Support another API OGC standard 🏄‍♀️
* Or just create something new and useful like [this](https://ivaucher.byteroad.net)
